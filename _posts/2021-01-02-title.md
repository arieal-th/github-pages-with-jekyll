Third day in a row of productivity. Unsure really what else to say about it. I'm always wary at the start like this. 
I've failed while deep in before, but especially at the start it's so easy to fall by the wayside. 
Go back into old habits. But... I know i can't keep doing that anymore. I have to keep working hard and moving forwards.
